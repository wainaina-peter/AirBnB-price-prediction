1. # Business Understanding

AirBnB serves as an intermediary between property owners and customers, facilitating the rental process. It allows listing owners to independently determine their own prices based on various factors. However, as AirBnB expands its operations, it would be beneficial for the platform to assist new owners in setting competitive prices that attract more customers and offer affordable accommodation options. To achieve this, I aim to develop a model that utilizes historical data patterns to establish an intelligent pricing mechanism.

  ## Analytical Question
Can one utilize historical data to intelligently price an airbnb listing at a competitive price which is neither too high or too low?

  ## Problem Statement
To build a ML predictive system that predicts the price of a listed airbnb based on a number of variables.

  ## Defining the Metric of Success
Having a model that has a low RMSE and high recall score.

  2. # Objectives
## Main Objective
To provide a reliable system (Predictive system) that a user will use to predict the price of a listing, maybe if they ant to set up an airbnb and wants to price it at per with the existing airbnbs in the same locale.

   ## Specific Objectives

3. # Data Understanding
- The data contains 48895 rows and 16 columns and it describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. 
- The data contains information about the id, host name, host_id, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbouhood, latitude, longitude, room type, price, minimum number of nights, number of reviews, last review, reviews per month, calculated host listings count, and availability during the year.
- The data is readily available for use at kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

4. # External Data-Source Validation
- Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.
- This public dataset is part of Airbnb.

5. # Data Preprocessing
  
6. # Exploratory Data Analysis
   
7. # Modelling

I built two models with an aim of seeing which model will perform better between the two, against evaluation metrics. The two models are:
-  Linear Regression Model
-  Random Forest Regression Model,
